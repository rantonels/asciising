# AsciIsing

## Ising model on the terminal

A small python simulation of the 2D Ising model displayed in ascii graphics. Just for fun, not for serious purposes. Run with

```bash
python asciising.py
```

and use the arrow keys to change temperature and external field. `q` to quit.

## Notes

This simulation uses the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm for sampling from the Boltzmann distribution. The units are chosen such that Boltzmann's constant and the spin coupling J are equal to 1.
